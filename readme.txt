== Description ==
* The objective is to generate a number of adversarial examples of the number "2" from the MNIST database
* The project was started with some prior knowledge of NN such as perceptrons and MLPs
* First time dealing with CNNs and TensorFlow

== Progress ==
* Read through TensorFlow tutorial on building a CNN network
* Defined the parameters for convolution layers/pool layers 1 and 2

== Things to do ==
* Read through tutorial on dense and logist layers + cost function
* Read through tutorial on sessions and run-time analysis on tensorflow
* Build CNN with less than 2% error
* Find a way to generate key pixel or data clusters that are associated with heavy weighting identifier of the number "6"
